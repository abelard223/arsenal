* Overview (03/11/2018, v1.29)
  rkt is a pod-native container engine for Linux. It is composable, secure, and
  built on standards. rkt does not have full OCI native support. Following OCI
  evolution and stabilization, it will become the preferred way over appc. However,
  rkt will continue to support the ACI image format and distribution mechanism.
  With the donation to CNCF, rkt repository is moved from:
    https://github.com/coreos/rkt
   to

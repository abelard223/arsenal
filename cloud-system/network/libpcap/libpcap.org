* Overview
  libpcap, a system-independent interface for user-level packet capture. libpcap
  provides a portable framework for low-level network monitoring. The libpcap
  interface supports a filtering mechanism based on the architecture in the BSD
  packet filter. A lot of tools are built on top of libpcap, e.g. nDPI, tcpdump,
  tshark, ntopng, nDPI, etc.
* Experiments
  See "code/learning/network/libpcap" for details.

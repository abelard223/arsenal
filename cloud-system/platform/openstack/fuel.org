#+STARTUP: overview

* Overview
  Fuel is an open-source tool that enables you to easily and quickly provision
  multiple OpenStack environments, as well as manage your environments after
  deployment. Fuel provides a web user interface (WUI), as well as a command-line
  user interface (CLI) and RESTful API for provisioning, configuration, and
  management of OpenStack environments. A link to the Horizon OpenStack Dashboard
  appears in the Fuel web UI after you deploy an OpenStack environment.

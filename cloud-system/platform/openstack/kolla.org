#+STARTUP: overview

* Overview (03/18/2017)
  Kolla provides Docker containers and Ansible playbooks to meet Kollaâ€™s mission.
  Kolla's mission is to provide production-ready containers and deployment tools
  for operating OpenStack clouds. Simply put, kolla enables deploying containerized
  openstack. Kolla (https://github.com/openstack/kolla) builds images which are
  used by Kolla-Ansible (https://github.com/openstack/kolla-ansible) to deploy
  OpenStack. The kolla-kubernetes (https://github.com/openstack/kolla-kubernetes)
  deliverable deploys OpenStack on top of Kubernetes, using helm.

#+STARTUP: overview

* Overview
  Kuryr is a Docker network plugin that uses Neutron to provide networking services
  to Docker containers. It provides containerised images for the common Neutron
  plugins. Background: it is a common problem in docker based solutions running
  on openstack that you run overlay (like flannel) on top of openstack overlay
  (e.g. ovs). Kuryr tries to solve the problem.
